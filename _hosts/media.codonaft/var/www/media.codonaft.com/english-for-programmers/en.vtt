00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:06.400
How long have you been learning English?
I want you to learn it effectively, to become a better developer.

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:12.800
In this video I will tell you how to continue learning English and NOT getting stuck.
And I will give you 10 tricks that helped me.

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm not going to stop at reasons to learn English.
You already know them.
In a few words, in our modern

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:25.600
actively changing world
which becomes more global,
you can't progress too far as a programmer,
until you, at least, will be able to read,

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:32.000
and, even better, to listen to technical English content.
Which I will refer in future a lot, by the way.

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:38.400
I'm not even talking about communicating with foreign coworkers.
This video is intended for those who can solve "Hello world" tasks like,

00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:44.800
talking about myself or about the weather outside the window.
So if you can't — it's not a problem. Just start studying with English teacher as soon as possible,

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:51.200
so you could handle tasks like that.
So, maybe you're that guy,

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:57.600
who's learning English REALLY HARD.
Maybe you use free tools like Lingualeo or Puzzle-English or something else,

00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:04.000
or you use English teachers and spend a lot of money on that.
Both ideas are great. But at some point

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:10.400
you may notice that your progress slows down for some reason.
I don't know if you noticed that,
but you can spend YEARS learning English

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:16.800
and still not being able to handle tasks like watching a programming video course,
or, say, a video from conference in English.

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:23.200
Or maybe you are able to handle that,
but now you are afraid to talk to foreign coworker or client.

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:29.600
That's strange. It's the whole point of it, isn't it?
Why it's so hard to achieve it? I think, unfortunately, the answer is

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:36.000
all these English learning tools: services, courses, teachers and so on,
they are just a sandbox.

00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:42.400
It's sort of an intro to English. It doesn't really matter how much time you spend on it.
Now you can argue that teachers and other stuff

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:48.800
help to prepare for English tests, like IELTS, while they are not really simple.
And that's right, they are specialized in that.

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:55.200
But English teacher will NEVER be able to discuss our specific topics with us:
functional programming

00:01:55.456 --> 00:02:01.600
or imperative programming,
static typing or dynamic typing.
What architecture

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:08.000
should we choose for this distributed system?
No, they won't be able to discuss these topics with us. They are not specialized in these areas.

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:14.400
They are specialized exactly in the stuff they teach: English grammar, and these common limited tasks.

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:20.800
About family, weather, hobbies or maybe something more complex, like economics.
But these topics have almost nothing to do with us.

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:27.200
In the best case they will be able to discuss computers from user perspective or something similar.
I'm not saying that studying with teacher is not effective,

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:33.600
don't get me wrong.
It's effective, when you take into account limitations of such education.

00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:40.000
So the first thing you need to admit is,
if you are JUST focused on learning ENGLISH,

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:46.400
and NOT focused on learning OUR topics USING English,
then you will stuck.
Actually you don't even need

00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:52.800
some crazy grammar level to watch courses and read articles about programming.

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:59.200
Or to leave comments at GitHub bug report page,
or to EVEN talk to a foreign coworker!
I encourage you to watch this free course,

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:05.600
all the links will be in the description.
You can use this course as a grammatical and lexical minimum that you need

00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:12.000
to start doing the things I mentioned.
If your grammar progressed beyond that — then you might be wasting your time.

00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:18.400
You are NOT going to use such complex grammar in the NEAR future and will likely forget it.
Two more things about grammar:

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:24.800
First of all, kids actually don't learn grammar while they are just starting to learn their native language,

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:31.200
just because there's no system to describe grammar which could be available for them, as they don't speak any language.
But it's not a problem.

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:37.600
They quickly learn how to describe stuff that happens in their head,
just by combining the phrases that they were able to remember from other person.

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:44.000
And the second point about grammar:
if you was learning our native language long time ago, using textbooks and other stuff,
then you likely noticed, that you

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:50.400
don't remember some parts of the grammar!
I'm not sure what exactly you may not remember, but for instance,
I wouldn't be able to recall anything about
verb conjugations in Russian language.

00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:56.800
I encourage you to think about this stuff: why it's happening and how this knowledge may help

00:03:57.056 --> 00:04:03.200
with foreign languages learning process optimization.
The next two videos will help you with that: one of them

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:09.600
is from EXTREMELY important course
about learning techniques for everything, not just natural language.

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:16.000
This course is CRITICAL for you, by the way.
I will mention it in the future as well.
And another video, from one GREAT English teacher!

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:22.399
I encourage you to watch ALL his content about learning techniques, which have been proved by studies.

00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:28.799
Now I want to move on to the main part of our topic,
to discuss tricks that helped me to progress in English the most.

00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:35.199
We will start from pretty obvious techniques and will go to less obvious ones.
Technique #1: Don't use Russian

00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:41.599
when learning English.
I think that learning English language using Russian language is...

00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:47.999
completely absurd!
You may disagree with me. But if you study with a personal teacher,

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:54.399
I really encourage you to ask them to NOT use Russian AT ALL during lessons,
and notice what effect it will produce to you.

00:04:54.655 --> 00:05:00.799
Imagine that THEY don't know Russian and YOU don't know Russian.
And you will both do whatever you can.

00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:07.199
Using vocabulary that you already have. Using intonation and gesticulation.
Don't underestimate gesticulation!

00:05:07.455 --> 00:05:13.599
It's a very powerful tool to explain things.
So, if you completely refuse using Russian at your lessons

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:19.999
this will stimulate you to switch to Russian less often.
Now English will become an exciting puzzle!

00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:26.399
Yes, it may create a little lag in the plan you have with the teacher.

00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:32.799
But you know, this plan is a freaking sandbox!
It's not important.
It's important to start USING the language! To practice it FOR REAL!

00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:39.199
To solve PROBLEMS with it!
EXPLAIN and UNDERSTAND things that YOU really CARE about!
It's not talking about the freaking weather outside the window!

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:45.599
So the first thing that becomes important to you automatically
is not weather and not even programming.

00:05:45.855 --> 00:05:51.999
It's English itself.
At this point you may experience problems with translating words from English to Russian and vice-versa.

00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:58.399
But at the same time you will easily explain meaning of an English word using other English words!

00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:04.799
It's exactly what you need!
It can remind you so-called compiler bootstrapping.
As C++ compiler can be written in C++,

00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:11.199
the same way, English can be and SHOULD BE learned with English itself! As soon as possible.

00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:14.527
As I'm not going to contradict myself, I will continue this discussion in English.

00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:17.343
(hilarious Runglish-speaking gentleman)

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.927
So turn on subtitles if you don't understand English speech and we will continue.

00:06:21.183 --> 00:06:26.071
#2: Start GRADUALLY replacing Russian content with English content.

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:33.471
Do you read articles at habr.com?
That's great! Many of them are translations from English.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:39.871
So every time you are going to read a translation,
instead try to read the original article.

00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:46.271
Podcasts, audio books, video blogs at YouTube.
The same thing.
Try original YouTube channels

00:06:46.527 --> 00:06:52.671
instead of watching dubbed videos.
You may have noticed that many vlogs and audio books

00:06:52.927 --> 00:06:59.071
were recorded with high quality.
And I don't just mean microphone quality or something,

00:06:59.327 --> 00:07:04.447
I also mean the voice. People really train their voice before performing this way.

00:07:04.703 --> 00:07:10.591
Ommm... Lower! Ommm... Lower! Ommm...
And basically you say

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:16.223
The letter Q, then E, then Q, then A-A-h.

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:22.367
So it's not really authentic voice that you may hear between native Americans. It's actually

00:07:22.623 --> 00:07:28.767
much simpler.
If you normally listen to music while driving your car or using public transport

00:07:29.023 --> 00:07:35.167
— try to update this habit with English audio books or podcasts.

00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:41.567
And one thing that you SHOULD be aware of is you don't need to understand ALL the little

00:07:41.823 --> 00:07:47.967
details you hear, inclusively.
You need to get the idea, the main parts!
This is the point of

00:07:48.223 --> 00:07:54.367
any content you use, including Russian content.
You may have noticed that you can't

00:07:54.623 --> 00:08:00.767
watch a video and then retell
all the little details to somebody,

00:08:01.023 --> 00:08:07.167
word for word.
We normally remember only MAJOR stuff, so major stuff is THE ONLY needed stuff.

00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:13.567
Don't worry about ignoring SOME PARTS of the videos.
Sometimes when we don't understand something IMPORTANT

00:08:13.823 --> 00:08:19.967
it's likely you will understand it later from context of the same video.

00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:26.367
#3: Prefer English over Russian when taking notes.
If you are going to make a list of food,

00:08:26.623 --> 00:08:32.767
why won't you make it in English?
It's not that hard.
Also so your internal tasks

00:08:33.023 --> 00:08:39.167
and reminders — you can write them in English as well.
Video courses.

00:08:39.423 --> 00:08:45.567
Writing quality notes for video courses is very important.
I wrote an entire article about that

00:08:45.823 --> 00:08:51.967
link in the description.
So if you are watching some English video course
why won't you write your notes in English as well?

00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:58.367
It could be actually EASIER to do that instead of making a translation to Russian.

00:08:58.623 --> 00:09:04.767
And you will have a better FOCUS on your course in this case.
This is where you're using English

00:09:05.023 --> 00:09:11.167
in the problems that YOU are personally facing in your life.
It's no some theoretical stuff

00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:17.567
you had in textbooks.
#4: Stop using Russian LOCALIZATION on any

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.103
of your devices!

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:20.895
It's time to STOP!

00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:27.039
Start using ALL software in English!
On your desktop, on your laptop, on your phone,

00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:33.439
your tablet or whatever else.
And also you will benefit from using English on

00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:39.839
the devices that you don't even own.
Self-ordering machines, for instance.
Do you order some

00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:46.239
junk food using such device?
That's fine. Now try to use English every time you do that.

00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:52.639
Or, for example, many ATMs will let you choose the language after inserting your

00:09:52.895 --> 00:09:59.039
payment card.
So you could select English and then withdraw or deposit your money.

00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:05.439
Don't be afraid of this stuff
there are not too many things you can do with ATM.

00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:11.839
#5: Find ugly parts on the language in Google.
Every natural language has its own poorly designed

00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:18.239
things.
For English one of them is probably prepositions.
When you are doing

00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:24.639
any kind of writing, instead of guessing which preposition you should use,
or instead of using some complex rules,

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:31.039
just Google the particular combination of words and check how many results you will get.

00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:37.439
In many cases you will find discussions which will tell you what is valid and what is not.

00:10:37.695 --> 00:10:43.839
Or what particular combination of words means if several ways are possible.

00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:50.239
#6: Improve your ability to LISTEN by practicing ACCURATE PRONUNCIATION.

00:10:50.495 --> 00:10:56.639
I noticed the more I practice pronunciation the better I actually hear

00:10:56.895 --> 00:11:03.039
the native English speech.
Notice that you will likely never be able to do that with your

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:09.439
non-native English teacher. If you have one.
You already pronounce things wrong and you keep

00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:15.839
replacing the wrong pronunciation. Without even noticing that.
And as you repeating it you are

00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:22.239
REINFORCING your WRONG MEMORY about that!
That could do the reason why you can't even HEAR

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:28.639
the right authentic pronunciation!
Just think about that.
And to fix that, one thing that you can try

00:11:28.895 --> 00:11:35.039
is singing songs that YOU personally enjoy.
This is how you can learn and practice

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:41.439
authentic English pronunciation. In a very enjoyable fashion.
It's very important that you

00:11:41.695 --> 00:11:47.839
choose the songs that YOU personally like.
It doesn't matter how complex they are

00:11:48.095 --> 00:11:54.239
Maybe they use some advanced vocabulary,
that you are not familiar with.
and that's fine, that's still

00:11:54.495 --> 00:12:00.639
not the point of this exercise.
Though you will probably see mistakes in lyrics.

00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:07.039
So don't ignore them.
Correct the mistakes every time you notice them.
And it doesn't even matter how fast it is

00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:13.439
You can slow the song down, if it's too fast for you.
The main goal is to be as accurate as the singer

00:12:13.695 --> 00:12:19.839
and of course I mean the pronunciation,
not your pitch accuracy or something.

00:12:20.095 --> 00:12:26.239
Record your voice, review it and work on mistakes.
The other thing that you could try is

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:32.639
to simulate native English teachers.
Here's one example of the teacher who teaches

00:12:32.895 --> 00:12:34.943
the American fast speech.

00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:41.087
Alright, another question "what do you mean?"
I never ask it like that! "hey, what do you mean?"

00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:47.487
That's just too complicated, right?
So I say "no, [wotduu] mean?", "[wotduu] mean?"
"how did it go?"
But I never say

00:12:47.743 --> 00:12:53.887
"how did it go"! I say "hey, [hada] go?", "[hada] go?"
Now, this is crazy, because I'm not even sayin' "how"

00:12:54.143 --> 00:12:57.727
I'm saying "ha"!

00:12:57.983 --> 00:13:03.871
#7: Try to THINK in English every time you are walking outside.

00:13:04.127 --> 00:13:10.271
I came up with this technique maybe 10 years ago or something,
when I was a student.
Every time I was

00:13:10.527 --> 00:13:16.671
going home alone, I was noticing that my inner voice is basically

00:13:16.927 --> 00:13:23.071
talking some random stuff.
And I started to play with it.
I was trying to switch it to English,

00:13:23.327 --> 00:13:29.471
even though I didn't know English so well at that time.
So the challenge was to

00:13:29.727 --> 00:13:35.871
either generate some English phrases
or just to be silent.
When I just "invented" this technique

00:13:36.127 --> 00:13:42.271
I was doing this for maybe several minutes and then I was switching back to Russian

00:13:42.527 --> 00:13:48.671
but after some practicing something clicked in me and I basically didn't need to use

00:13:48.927 --> 00:13:55.071
Russian anymore while walking on the streets.
So that was probably the MOST EFFECTIVE

00:13:55.327 --> 00:14:01.471
practice for SPEAKING that I have ever used.
And I'm still surprised that many teachers

00:14:01.727 --> 00:14:07.871
probably won't ever tell you about that.
It's RIDICULOUSLY simple and at the same time

00:14:08.127 --> 00:14:14.271
VERY powerful!
So if you are a shy and you don't want to practice your speaking

00:14:14.527 --> 00:14:20.671
with somebody — you can actually practice it WITH YOURSELF.
Yes, there's still a problem with

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:27.071
verification of the stuff that talk about.
But it's definitely more productive than

00:14:27.327 --> 00:14:33.471
going like a zombie and generating some random Russian nonsense

00:14:33.727 --> 00:14:39.871
instead of English random nonsense.
#8: Simplify your thoughts.

00:14:40.127 --> 00:14:46.271
Our native language is a very complex thing
And sometimes

00:14:46.527 --> 00:14:52.671
It's hard to express our Russian thoughts in other language.
Because we don't know

00:14:52.927 --> 00:14:59.071
this language so well. Or because of the lack of some concepts in this language.

00:14:59.327 --> 00:15:05.471
So every time you experience that, notice what's actually important.

00:15:05.727 --> 00:15:11.871
what MESSAGE are you trying to deliver.
Don't focus on little things you can't remember,

00:15:12.127 --> 00:15:18.271
or you're not sure about.
Get rid of all the unnecessary things or generalize them.

00:15:18.527 --> 00:15:24.671
Generalizing means selecting a word with more general meaning.

00:15:24.927 --> 00:15:31.071
#9: Memorize valid phrases and use them to build build new valid phrases.

00:15:31.327 --> 00:15:37.471
You may have noticed that memorizing single words, without context, just doesn't work.

00:15:37.727 --> 00:15:43.871
It's not effective!
It's not how our brain works.
We need to ASSOCIATE words together!

00:15:44.127 --> 00:15:50.271
Combinations of words — this is what we memorize effectively.

00:15:50.527 --> 00:15:56.671
And I hope you already have some benefit from that.
Just by COMBINING some parts that you have heard from somebody,

00:15:56.927 --> 00:16:03.071
you can produce grammatically correct and beautiful speech in many cases.

00:16:03.327 --> 00:16:09.471
But what if I tell you that you can memorize longer combinations? The entire sentences.

00:16:09.727 --> 00:16:15.871
And modify them during actually talking IN REAL TIME.
Let's take a look at example

00:16:16.127 --> 00:16:22.271
Suppose you want to express some strange complex idea

00:16:22.527 --> 00:16:28.671
Using passive form of present perfect tense.
Or something similar.

00:16:28.927 --> 00:16:35.071
And you are like "damn I didn't practice this thing so much!
I'm not sure how to say it's right."

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:41.471
What you can do though is to RECALL some phrase,
which could be very similar to what you want to say.

00:16:41.727 --> 00:16:47.871
For instance, you can recall something like
"I have been told that studying algorithms

00:16:48.127 --> 00:16:54.271
is very important".
And you also need to remember that "told" is

00:16:54.527 --> 00:17:00.671
In the past participle form here. And the word "have" is in the relation with "I".

00:17:00.927 --> 00:17:07.071
And now, to get what you want, you just update some parts of this sentence,
with words

00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:13.471
in the same form. And maintain the consistency of the grammar.
"They have been told

00:17:13.727 --> 00:17:19.871
that studying algorithms is very important"
"This code has been written

00:17:20.127 --> 00:17:26.271
by me".
Or whatever.
It's like a change of variables in mathematics.

00:17:26.527 --> 00:17:32.671
And I think it's the NATURAL way to use the language.
It's different from using

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:39.071
those walls of text.
You can't just visualize such things in your head, while actually talking.

00:17:39.327 --> 00:17:45.471
Our temporary memory is way more limited.
So I want YOU to find the valid phrases

00:17:45.727 --> 00:17:51.871
that you personally find hard to build.
And just memorize them. And after

00:17:52.127 --> 00:17:58.271
memorizing them, trying to PLAY with them, while actually talking in real time.

00:17:58.527 --> 00:18:04.671
And finally, the last technique!
#10: Listen and dub

00:18:04.927 --> 00:18:11.071
videos that you personally like.
And try to simulate a professional

00:18:11.327 --> 00:18:12.351
translation to Russian.

00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:24.383
No, no, no! Not some shitty translation,
but a PROFESSIONAL one!

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:30.783
This is actually an advanced technique.
I think it's useful for those of you who want to improve your English from

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:37.183
upper-intermediate to advanced level.
And this technique may sound like a contradiction to the first technique, which was

00:18:37.439 --> 00:18:43.583
Don't use Russian when learning English.
But actually it's just a different technique,

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:49.983
for different purposes.
It's designed to improve your listening first of all and your vocabulary.

00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:56.383
You will learn new phrasal verbs and modern idioms.
I personally started to play with video dubbing

00:18:56.639 --> 00:19:02.783
in 2015. And I remember I didn't even have any subtitles,
even auto generated.

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:09.183
So it was a bit challenging.
Sometimes I literally listened to some parts of the videos

00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:15.583
for 20 times on different speeds,
until I could actually get things right.

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:21.983
Sometimes I was skipping some strange parts
and eventually I could understand them later from context
of the same video.

00:19:22.239 --> 00:19:28.383
So in complex cases it's like a puzzle:
you're trying to guess the right interpretation,
by combining

00:19:28.639 --> 00:19:34.783
the parts you have already heard
and by understanding the context.
After translating a relatively short video

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:41.183
30 minutes of something, I improved my listening skills dramatically.
Just from one video!

00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:47.583
You need to choose a video with a bit HIGHER level than you currently have.
It's very important!

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:53.983
So, I mean the video that contains some minor parts that you don't understand while watching it.
When you was watching it,

00:19:54.239 --> 00:20:00.383
it was okay to not understand some minor parts.
But now it's time to figure them out!
Which may not be

00:20:00.639 --> 00:20:06.783
as simple as you may think.
In some cases you will find stuff that you just couldn't see in textbooks,

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:13.183
like new idioms or culture-related jokes,
or just very complex terminology

00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:19.583
which you will likely want to validate with official translations of the books or articles that

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:25.983
affect the same topic.
And obviously you can't rely on... whatever is written here, it's all a big lie!
Not only auto generated, but any subtitles.

00:20:26.239 --> 00:20:32.383
It's the same thing as with lyrics for songs.
Now I want to share you the tools

00:20:32.639 --> 00:20:38.783
that I use to translate the videos.
context.reverso.net — this tool takes a phrase as input,

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:45.183
and shows a translation in a context of some text.
It's probably the most common tool I use.

00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:51.583
It's very important to see the words in a context,
to understand their true meaning.

00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:57.983
Wikipedia and Wiktionary.
Once again they are great tools for ambiguous words.
You just find the most accurate meaning

00:20:58.239 --> 00:21:04.383
and then open a corresponding Russian article.
Books, if they are mentioned in the video.
You can find the official

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:10.783
translations of such books.
This will help you translate some tricky terminology.
StarDict.

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:17.184
Especially the Oxford dictionaries
that you can additionally install in this program.
StarDict has a great

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:23.584
fuzzy search implementation.
So it's perfect for finding unknown words when you are not sure about the spelling.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.984
Merriam-Webster it's a great tool for finding new English words.
Urban Dictionary this one

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:36.384
is a GREAT tool for America slang!
Although I'm not sure how reliable it is,
but still it's very powerful in complex cases.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.784
You can also modify and develop your own tools, to optimize

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.184
dubbing quality and performance.
And I will talk about that in the future episodes.
A challenge that you will most probably face

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.584
Is that you actually don't know Russian so well to make the translations professionally.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:01.984
That's very underestimated thing that many non-professional dubbers and article translators have.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:08.384
Hopefully this exercise will encourage you to stop reading any article translations.
As quickly as possible.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.784
You probably have no clue how inaccurate they are on average.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:21.184
Okay. Now in summary,
don't use Russian when you are learning English.
And this will mostly affect your speaking.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:27.584
Start gradually replacing Russian content with English content.
And that's very good for reading and listening.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.984
Prefer English over Russian when taking notes,
if you want to improve your writing.
Stop using

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:40.384
Russian localization on any of your devices,
to improve reading.
Find ugly parts of the language

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.784
in Google to improve writing.
Practice accurate pronunciation to improve listening,

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:53.184
and speaking of course.
Think in English when you are walking outside,
to improve speaking.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.584
Simplify your thoughts to improve speaking first of all
Memorize valid phrases and use them

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.984
to build new valid phrases.
And it's a very powerful technique for speaking as well.
Listen and dub

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:12.384
videos that you personally enjoy,
to improve almost everything.
And the last thing I'd like to say

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.784
is you need to choose your techniques wisely.
Start asking questions like what skill I'm trying to improve?

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:25.184
Is it reading, speaking or something else?
Did this particular technique really help me with this skill?

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.584
Is there a scientific evidence that this technique actually works?
Or the opposite thing

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.850
Is there an evidence that this technique definitely doesn't work?
There are quite a lot of researches on this topic nowadays.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Nu i vse na etom...

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.408
